## Connecting Lovable Frontend to Your Deployed ADK Agent on Cloud Run

Once you have successfully deployed your ADK (Agent Development Kit) agent to Google Cloud Run using the `gcloud run deploy` command, it will be accessible via a public URL. Here's how to connect your Lovable frontend to this deployed backend:

1.  **Obtain the Cloud Run Service URL:**
    *   After a successful deployment, the `gcloud run deploy` command will output the **Service URL**. This URL is the public endpoint for your ADK agent.
    *   It will look something like this: `https://{NOME_DO_SERVICO}-{RANDOM_HASH}-{REGION_CODE}.a.run.app` (e.g., `https://my-adk-agent-abcdef123-uc.a.run.app`).
    *   You can also find this URL in the Google Cloud Console by navigating to your Cloud Run service.

2.  **Configure Your Lovable Frontend:**
    *   Your Lovable frontend application needs to be configured to send its API requests to this Cloud Run Service URL.
    *   The ADK agent, by default, often exposes an HTTP endpoint for interactions. This is typically a `POST` request to a specific path. Common paths for ADK agents might be `/invoke`, `/chat`, or `/generate`. You'll need to confirm the exact path from the ADK documentation or your agent's specific implementation (e.g., by looking at the `main.py` or `api_server.py` if you customized it).
    *   Locate the part of your Lovable frontend's configuration or code where the backend API endpoint is defined and update it to use the new Cloud Run Service URL.

3.  **Request Format and Headers:**
    *   **HTTP Method:** ADK agents usually expect `POST` requests for invoking agent functionality.
    *   **Content-Type:** Ensure your frontend is sending the request body in the correct format, typically JSON. Therefore, the `Content-Type: application/json` header is usually required.
    *   **Request Body:** The JSON payload sent by your frontend should match the structure expected by your ADK agent's input schema.
    *   **Lovable-Specific Headers:** If your Lovable frontend uses its own authentication mechanism (e.g., sending a Bearer token to authenticate Lovable users), these headers should continue to be included in the requests sent to your Cloud Run ADK agent. The ADK agent itself might not act on these Lovable-specific tokens, but they might be necessary for the Lovable platform.
    *   **ADK Agent Specific Headers:** Check if your ADK agent expects any other custom headers.

4.  **Authentication (`--allow-unauthenticated`):**
    *   In the `gcloud run deploy` command provided, the `--allow-unauthenticated` flag was used. This makes your Cloud Run service endpoint publicly accessible. The Lovable frontend can directly call this URL without needing to authenticate with Google Cloud IAM.
    *   If you had deployed your Cloud Run service *without* `--allow-unauthenticated` (i.e., as a private service), the Lovable frontend (or an intermediary backend acting on its behalf) would need to authenticate to Cloud Run. This typically involves obtaining a Google-signed ID token for an authorized service account or user and sending it in the `Authorization: Bearer <ID_TOKEN>` header of each request to the Cloud Run service.

5.  **Verify API Paths and Structure:**
    *   If you are unsure about the specific API path (e.g., `/invoke`) or the exact JSON structure your ADK agent expects, consult:
        *   The official ADK documentation.
        *   Any `openapi.json` or Swagger/OpenAPI documentation generated by your ADK agent.
        *   The `api_server` component of your ADK agent. The FastAPI (or other framework) setup will define the routes.
        *   Cloud Run service logs (accessible via Google Cloud Console Logging). These logs can show incoming requests and how your agent is processing them, which can be helpful for debugging.

**Example Configuration (Conceptual):**

Imagine your Lovable frontend has a configuration file (e.g., `config.js` or environment variables) like this:

```javascript
// Before: Pointing to a local or different backend
// const ADK_AGENT_API_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8000/invoke";

// After: Pointing to your Cloud Run service URL
const ADK_AGENT_API_ENDPOINT = "https://my-adk-agent-abcdef123-uc.a.run.app/invoke"; // Replace with your actual URL and path
```

Your frontend's API call logic would then use `ADK_AGENT_API_ENDPOINT` to send requests.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully connect your Lovable frontend to the ADK agent running on Cloud Run, enabling users to interact with your agent through the Lovable interface.
